Description:
The Adobe Flex SDK contains tools, source code and libraries to build and
deploy Flash and AIR applications.

Local Modifications:
ResizingTextBase.as a copy of Flex 3.2 mx.controls.Text.as with a 
modification of the private measure function to support resizing text.

ResizingTextBase differes from Text in the following ways:
 - Change the class, file, and constructor name
 - Change some includes to get it to compile in a new location
 - Override getMinimumText() to return "" instead of null
 - Tweak measureUsingWidth() to include padding and set word wrap to true
