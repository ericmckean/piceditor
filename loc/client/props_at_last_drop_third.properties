NutFrameEffect._strHelpText = Nuts. What says Christmas more than a bowl full of unshelled nuts? Nutcrackers are traditional decoration. Tchaikovsky even wrote a ballet about them. Indeed, The Nutcracker is probably the only ballet most people will ever see in their lives. Nuts run through our holiday traditions as strong as a walnut shell or, even harder, one of those annoying sharp little almonds that are so tough to crack and always stab you in the palm when they pop out of the little metal nutcracker your mother only ever gets out for the annual holiday party. So it just wouldn't be the holidays without them, so what would the holidays be without this essential <font color=\\\"#000000\\\"><b>Nut Frame?</b></font><br><br>It's so easy to use. Simply put your favorite festive snap -- Family Portraits work especially well -- inside of a Nut Frame, adjust the <font color=\\\"#000000\\\"><b>Size</b></font> and <font color=\\\"#000000\\\"><b>Density</b></font> and hit <font color=\\\"#000000\\\"><b>Apply.</b></font><br><br><font color=\\\"#000000\\\"><b>Tip:</b></font> Nuts Frame works great over any photo as a stylish and meaningful Christmas card.
