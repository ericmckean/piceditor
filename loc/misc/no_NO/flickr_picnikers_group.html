Welcome to the Flickr Picniker Pool, where all Flickr-connected Picnikers can come together to show off their <a href="http://www.mywebsite.com/" target="_blank">Picniked</a> pics, share hints, and disclose those clever tricks.

<b>About the Picnik Pool:</b>
This is the place for showing off your Picnik powers. So please! If your photos, however worthy, have not been touched by the power of Picnik, this is not the place for them. 

We’re especially keen on people sharing before-and-after photos with an explanation of how they did what they did. We regularly review photos here and award the best of the best with the official and coveted <b>Picnik Pick</b> badge:

In addition, Picture of the Week awards, themed contests, Most Interesting awards, and more, will all be announced here. 

<b>Rules:</b> The posting limit is five before-and-after sets per day, with at least one from each set tagged “Picnik” 

<b>Looking for help?</b> Use the Contact Us link inside the Picnik menu when you're using Picnik, or <a href="mailto:feedback@mywebsite.com">Email us</a>  with any feedback you have and we’ll be able to help you there!

<b>Happy Picniking!</b>
