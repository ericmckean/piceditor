# Styling Piceditor #

Piceditor will need to be styled before it is usable. Here are some quick styling tips.

## Copy ##
All text labels are files at client/loc/en\_US/**.properties. This copy will need to be updated as appropriate for your application. If you keep all of your text in these files, it should be easy to localize your editor.**

## CSS ##
Much but not all of the styling can be controlled with CSS. Figure out which parts you want to keep and use CSS to style them.

CSS styles are very powerful. Refer to the Flash Builder documentation for more information
