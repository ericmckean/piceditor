	<p>As you requested, here is your sign up information for Picnik. We now have an 'beta' version that is ready for you to play with, and we'd greatly like your feedback.  This is among the first of several releases that will come in the future.  Are we onto something? Or are we off our rockers? What are we missing?  Please tell us.</p>
	<h3 style="font:bold 18px/12px 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: #4d4d4d; margin:25px 0 0 0;">What is Picnik?</h3>
	<p>Picnik lets you edit all your Flickr photos with powerful but easy tools. Think of it as "90% of what most people would use in Photoshop at 10% of the effort/time." And just as importantly, Picnik easily imports/exports photos from your Flickr account seamlessly, all from within your web browser <strong>without installing any software.</strong></p>
	<p>It's the concept of "great pictures, anywhere". You access and edit all your online photos from one easy place. Open your browser, and it just works.</p>
	<h3 style="font:bold 18px/12px 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: #4d4d4d; margin:25px 0 0 0;">Getting Started</h3>

	<h3 style="font:bold 18px/12px 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: #4d4d4d; margin:25px 0 0 0;">Giving Feedback</h3>
	<p>You can give feedback 2 easy ways;</p>
	<p><strong>1.</strong>  Right inline in the app itself. There is a simple "Feedback" button on the bottom and in the Help menu. Feel free to offer general impressions, criticisms, bugs, new ideas, or encouragement as you see fit. This truly is our first opportunity to trap substantive feedback so please have at it!</p>
	<p><strong>2.</strong>  The second way is provide us feedback is to join our forums (<a href="http://www.mywebsite.com/forums/" style="color:#6d9d31;">www.mywebsite.com/forums</a>). We'll be making future posts regarding Picnik updates there.</p>
	<h3 style="font:bold 18px/12px 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: #4d4d4d; margin:25px 0 0 0;">The Future</h3>
	<p>So where are we going?  This 'beta' is just the beginning.  We want Picnik to be your one-stop-shop for all your photos needs. There are still many, many exciting things that we have in store; more features, more bridges to other sites besides Flickr, even greater seamlessness between where your photos are and your editing. You will start to feel like you're always just one or two clicks away from being an Ansel Adams, Cartier-Bresson, or Herb Ritts.</p>
	<p>As a matter of fact, your feedback at this crucial stage is precisely what will help us to refine what will be most useful.</p>
	<p><strong>See you in Picnik!</strong></p>
