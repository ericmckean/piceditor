Picnik is photo editing awesomeness, online, in your browser. It's the easiest way on the Web to fix underexposed photos, remove red-eye, or apply effects to your photos. 
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>What can I do with Picnik?</b></font>
<br>
Pretty much everything! We've got amazing Edit tools that can fix just about anything that could possibly go wrong with a photograph. Lacking photo-editing prowess? A bunch of our editing tools are one-click fixes, including auto- fix, exposure, colors, and red-eye. And the others, like rotate, crop, resize, and sharpening, can be controlled with easy-to-use sliders.<br>
<br>
Move over to the Create tab and you'll see our custom-made Effects (most of which have the ability to be painted into just the areas of your image where you want them), an awesome text tool with dozens of fonts, dozens of shapes, including seasonal shapes for holidays and events, and some super customizable frames. Not to mention the touch up tools and new Advanced Editing tools.<br>
To find out more, check out the forums at <font color="#618430"><a href="http://forums.mywebsite.com/index.php/topic,609.0.html" target="_blank">forums.mywebsite.com</a></font>
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>I'm head over heels in love. Can I pay you guys for more awesomeness?</b></font><br>
Absolutely! Picnik Premium is available in three handy sizes: $4.95 a month, $19.95 for six months or $24.95 for a year (that's about $2.08 a month!) and gets you access to way, way more cool stuff. You'll get a completely ad-free experience, all the effects, dozens of shapes and fonts, plus previews of new features, premium support, and advanced editing tools like Curves and Levels!! Add to that the ability to layer photos using the Photo Basket, create collages with up to 64 photos and create multiple shows with up to 100 photos!<br>
<br>
You get unlimited access to all your favorite photo websites right from inside Picnik, including Flickr, Facebook, Picasa Web Albums, Photobucket and Webshots.  Transfer photos to and from those different sites with ease!<br>
And, while you're having fun doing all that, we'll keep perfect and limitless track of all the changes you do to all your photos, which photos you used, where you stored them, and unlimited undo!
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>What's the difference between Free and Premium?</b></font>
<br>
<b>Free:</b> Dozens and dozens of fonts, shapes, frames, collages, fancy collages, many of the effects and a couple of the touch-up tools are yours. Plus, all the Edit tools, the ability to undo everything you've ever done to your picture, and it remembers the history of the past five pictures you worked on!
<br><br>
<font color="#005580"><b>Premium:</b></font> All that and then some! You get ALL the effects, frames, fonts, shapes, plus NEW advanced editing tools like Curves and Levels, which have all the power found in expensive software packages but with one-click defaults. Full access to our Clone tool which allows you to add or remove  items in your images. Special seasonal shapes and effects just for you! You also get Priority Help Support, new feature previews, professional FontShop fonts and other exclusive content, the ability to access all your favorite photo sites at the same time to use Picnik to transfer photos between them, unlimited Photo History, a completely ad-free experience, AND the warm fuzzies of knowing you helped support a little photo-editor startup!
<br><br>
We love <b>all</b> our users and will keep adding to the Free and Premium versions of Picnik so either version will be the best available.

<font size="18" color="#005580"><b>Premium Questions:</b></font>
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>What is the Picnik Premium renewal policy? How do i turn off auto-renewal?</b></font><br>
Subscriptions are monthly, biannual, or annual and will auto-renew at the subscription expiration. Auto-renew settings can be changed by the user in the 'My Account' page. If you do not want to be automatically renewed, be sure to uncheck the auto-renew box and press 'Save Settings' to complete.  For 6 or 12 month credit card customers, we'll remind you before we charge so you have the option of updating your auto-renew preference. 
<br><br>
Note: Auto-renew settings for PayPal subscriptions can be changed by the user in their PayPal account. After 48 hours for monthly subscribers or 31 days for six months and annual subscribers, head to the History section of the 'My Account' page.  Click ‘View all Transactions’ and change the dates to include the time of your premium subscription transaction.  When you choose to cancel the account, this will shut off auto-renew but keep your account active until the original expiration date.  
<br><br>

<font size="15"><b>How do I change from a monthly to a six month or yearly subscription?</b></font><br>
If you upgraded for a month, and would like to change your subscription, you must first cancel your current subscription before you upgrade again.<br><br>
Head to the homepage and click on 'My Account'.  Uncheck the auto-renew box and press 'Save Settings' to complete. If you are within the cancellation grace period, you can select the cancel option. You can also see your account expiration date under the 'My Account' page.  When your account has expired, you can upgrade again to a six month or yearly subscription by logging into your account and pressing Upgrade to Premium in the right corner of your screen.
<br><br>
<b>PayPal Users:</b> Before upgrading again you must first cancel your current account. You will need to go directly to PayPal.com and go to the History section of the 'My Account' page. Click ‘View all Transactions’ and change the dates to include the time of your premium subscription transaction purchase.  Then return to the Picnik 'My Account' page and check out when your account expires.  Please upgrade again after this date; unfortunately, if you upgrade before then, our system may not recognize the new charge. 

<br><br>

<font size="15"><b>What happens if my Premium account expires?</b></font><br>
No worries, you can still use Picnik as a non-Premium user. However, users should be aware that since the addition of our Multi-File Upload History (of 100 recently uploaded files) and Unlimited Save History, canceling your Picnik Premium account risks losing both those Histories except the five most recent uploads and five most recent saved files. We'll save your files for one month to give you a chance to renew, but after that we cannot guarantee that your stuff will still be waiting for you.
<br><br>

<font size="15"><b>Who do I contact to talk about my credit card questions?</b></font><br>
Email us at <font color="#618430"><a href="mailto:billing@mywebsite.com" target="_blank">billing@mywebsite.com</a></font>, and we'll get right back to you.
<br><br>

<font size="15"><b>How do I cancel my Premium account?</b></font><br>
During the first 30 days - or 48 hours in the case of a monthly subscription - the subscription can be canceled by the user and credited 100%.  To do this, go to the 'My Account' page and  select the cancel option. After 30 days, the subscription can be canceled by emailing <font color="#618430"><a href="mailto:billing@mywebsite.com" target="_blank">billing@mywebsite.com</a></font>. To ensure proper credit, you'll need to email us from the account with which you signed up for a Picnik account and provide a reason for cancellation. Your credit card will be refunded a pro-rated amount.
<br>
Note: PayPal users must log into their PayPal account and head to the History section of the 'My Account' page.  Click ‘View all Transactions’ and change the dates to include the time of your premium subscription transaction.  Then choose the option to cancel your subscription.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Where's PayPal? I thought you had PayPal as a payment option?</b></font><br>
We offered PayPal as a form of payment for a number of months. Unfortunately it did not meet our or our customer's needs when it comes to a clean, painless payment mechanism. Current PayPal customers will continue their subscriptions through renewal or expiration.  New subscribers can use our credit card process.  Thank you!
<br><br>


<font size="18" color="#005580"><b>Other Issues:</b></font>
<br>
<font size="15"><b>How big can my photo be?</b></font><br>
To keep Picnik running briskly, we resize your photos to 2800 pixels. This is plenty big to make high quality prints at 8 x 10 (A4 paper). Registered and Premium members can change their Photo Quality default settings from "Print" to "Archival" in the 'My Account' Page, while Guests' photos will always be resized. If you're using Picnik as a guest and want to change this setting, registering is free and easy.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Can I really get photos from anywhere?</b></font><br>
Pretty much! Right now Picnik makes it easy for you to pull photos straight from any of several photo sharing sites including Flickr, Picasa Web Albums, Facebook, Photobucket, Webshots.  You can also enter the URL for <b>ANY</b> website (your blog, MySpace page, etc.) and Picnik can pull photos from there for you to edit as well.  When you save a photo, you can choose where you want it saved...and we make this really easy.  Remember: most of the images on the internet are copyrighted. Make sure you have permission before you reuse someone else's photo!
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>How do I edit photos from my hard drive?</b></font><br>
Easy as pie. You can pull in photos straight from your computer&#8217;s hard drive under the 'Library' tab, 'Get from Computer' section.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Does Picnik offer layering?</b></font><br>
 Yes it does! If you are a Premium member you can  open the photo you want on the bottom of the layering. Then in the Edit or Create tab pull up the Photo Basket at the bottom and drag and drop the images you want on top over the photo and resize them.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>If I save my picture back out to Flickr, will it overwrite the original photo or post a new photo?</b></font><br>
This depends on the type of Flickr account you have.  If you have a basic (free) Flickr account, saving a Picnik-ed photo back out to Flickr will add a new photo to your existing album.  If you have a premium Flickr account, you have the option of either overwriting the original photo, or saving a new copy.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>If I rename a Flickr photo in Picnik, will the change be reflected in Flickr?</b></font><br>
Yes.  Picnik wants to simplify your photos experience in everyway possible.  If you rename a photo or change a description in Picnik, those changes will simply be reflected at the photo's source as if they were one and the same.  This also works in Picasa Web Albums.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Can I email my photos to my friends using Picnik?</b></font><br>
You sure can.  Picnik allows you to email your photos to any email address under the 'Save &amp; Share', 'Email Photo' tab. And Picnik will never, <b>ever</b> send unsolicited email to these email addresses. 
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>How far back does 'Undo' really go?</b></font><br>
All the way.  One cool feature of Picnik is you never have to worry about making a mistake; 'Undo' can take the photo all the way back to its original state one edit at a time if you choose.
<br><br>

<font size="15"><b>I forgot my password, and then I forgot my username! What do I do?</b></font><br>
As long as you gave Picnik a valid email when you signed up, you're OK. Just click the 'Sign in' link at the top right of Picnik, then click the 'Request a new password' link at the top right of the sign in dialog. Enter in your email address and we'll send you a new password right away.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>What about my privacy? Does Picnik share my content with anyone?</b></font><br>
No. We believe privacy is very important and we are protective of the privacy of our users' content. For our full privacy policy, see 'Privacy Policy.'
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Are you going to add more editing features or creative tools?</b></font><br>
We're working hard on that.  But <b>YOU</b> can help us better understand what new features might be most useful by posting to the Wishlist section of the <font color="#618430"><a href="http://forums.mywebsite.com/index.php?board=4.0" target="_blank">Forums</a></font>.  Please tell us what additional tools you'd like to see that would truly make Picnik your 'one-stop-shop' for editing all your digital photos.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>How do I keep apprised of Picnik's updates?</b></font><br>
Check out <font color="#618430"><a href="http://blog.mywebsite.com/" target="_blank">our blog</a></font>; we're constantly improving Picnik and adding new features. Plus, if you don't have a Premium Account, make sure to Register to get occasional emails about our important news and updates. 

<br><br>

<font size="18" color="#005580"><b>Troubleshooting:</b></font>
<br>
<font size="15"><b>What are the system requirements for running Picnik?</b></font><br>
At minimum we recommend that you have Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7, Mac OS X or Linux, with a 1GHz processor or better, and at least 512 MB of RAM. You will also need a web browser such as <font color="#618430"><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank"> Google Chrome</a></font>, Internet Explorer version 6.0 or higher, Firefox 2.0 or higher, or Safari 2 or higher.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Why did I need to download Flash 9 or 10 to run Picnik?</b></font><br>
Picnik itself is a lightweight and 'download-less' experience. But it does require  <font color="#618430"><b><a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank">Flash</a></b></font> to be installed in order to have the rich, full-featured experience of photo-editing within a browser.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Will Picnik affect my computer&#8217;s performance?</b></font><br>
No, Picnik was built with performance in mind and we consider its speed one of its many advantages over other photo editing solutions. Because it runs in a web browser, you should be able to run Picnik in much the same way that you would any other web app.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>What do I do if Picnik does not load, or only loads the title bar?
<br>What do I do if I get errors when trying to Save my photos?
</b></font>
<br>
This behavior means that the local settings and configurations on your computer or network are preventing Picnik from working properly.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Refresh or restart your browser</b></font>
<br>
First, it is amazing how many issues can be resolved with refreshing or reloading your browser and then Picnik.  Click the refresh button in your browser or press Ctrl+F5 for a forced, unconditional refresh.  If that doesn't help, completely shutdown and restart your browser.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Reinstall Flash</b></font>
<br>
Try installing or re-installing the latest version of Flash player (even if you already have it installed), using one of the following links:
<br>
<font color="#618430"><b><a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank">Download
Flash Player for Windows (2000, XP, Vista or Win7) here &#187;</a></b></font>
<br>
<font color="#618430"><b><a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank">Download
Flash Player for Mac OS X (all processors) here &#187;</a></b></font>
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Delete your Flash cookies (Flash Shared Objects).</b></font><br>
Occasionally Flash's shared objects (cookies) can cause unpredictable behavior\problems for Picnik.  An easy and harmless thing to try is to delete these cookies.  Adobe provides a mechanism to do this at the following link: <font color="#618430"><b><a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/settmgr_storage_en" target="_blank">Website Storage Settings Panel &#187;</a></b></font>.  Please select all of the "Picnik" items and Delete them, close this window and refresh your browser.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Clear your browser cache</b></font>
<br>
Clearing your browser cache can also clear up a lot of these issues:<br>
<b>In IE8: </b>click Safety:Delete Browsing History, then click Delete Temporary Internet Files and Delete Cookies.<br>
<b>In IE7: </b>click Tools:Delete Browsing History, then click Delete Files and Delete Cookies.<br>
<b>In Firefox 3.5: </b>go to Tools:Clear Recent History. <br>
<b>In Safari: </b> choose the gear menu and then Reset Safari:Empty Cache and Remove All Cookies.<br>
<b>In Google Chrome: </b>Click the Wrench: Options and click Clear Browsing Data.<br>
<br>
<font size="15"><b>Test your Firefox Add-ons</b></font>
<br>
If you use Firefox, try disabling your add-ons (extensions) like Adblock, Flashblock, or NoScript. Then if that works, re-enable them one at a time to determine which is causing the problem.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Test your firewall or virus detector</b></font>
<br>
If you are using a personal Internet firewall or anti-virus program, it could be blocking Flash applications like Picnik. Try allowing access to http://www.mywebsite.com and https://www.mywebsite.com within those programs and then try visiting Picnik again. If still no results, try disabling such programs entirely as a test. If that solves the issue, contact customer support for your security software to discuss allowing Flash content when browsing the internet.
<br><br>
If none of the above steps allow the Picnik to run properly, please hit the Feedback button in the upper right corner of your screen.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>What if I'm having troubles uploading photos?</b></font>
<br>
Please try our Basic Uploader under the Get from Computer tab or here <font color="#618430"><a href="http://www.mywebsite.com/go/upload" target="_blank"> http://www.mywebsite.com/go/upload</a> </font>.  Also, please try uploading a smaller file or resolution size as a test; please also check to see if you can upload from another computer.
<br><br>
Please check our <font color="#618430"><a href="http://forums.mywebsite.com/index.php/topic,604.0.html" target="_blank"><b>forums</b></a></font> for further ideas.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>What if I am having trouble saving photos?</b></font>
<br>
If you have trouble saving photos to your computer with the big green Save Photo button, try the Basic Downloader link located directly under it. This gives you two additional ways to save your masterpiece. First you browser will try to download it for you. If that doesn't work, first check to see if your browser blocked the file by clicking the bar at the top of the screen then selecting Download File, or click the "here" link and it gives you the option to right click and "Save picture as..."
<br>
<br>
Also, if you are running Adobe flash player 10 there is a direct upload feature that allows you to start editing your photo immediately while it is fully uploaded to our servers. That means you could also be trying to save it before it is fully uploaded in which case we give you an error (often it will say "Processing 1 item").  This happens more often with collages as we try to upload all the images quickly.  Try giving it a few minutes after uploading (or hitting "Done!" in collage) before heading over to the Save & Share tab.
Check out this <font color="#618430"><a href="http://forums.mywebsite.com/index.php/topic,604.0.html" target="_blank">forum post </a></font>for more information.

<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Does my connection speed\bandwidth matter to Picnik opening or saving photos?</b></font>
<br>
It certainly can - Picnik is designed for fast high bandwidth connections (particularly for uploading and downloading). To verify you're getting at least 1200 kbps <b>download</b> from your broadband connection, try visiting a speed-test site (here are a couple that we like):
<br>
- <font color="#618430"><a href="http://www.bandwidthplace.com" target="_blank">Bandwidth Place Speed Test</a> </font><br />
- <font color="#618430"><a href="http://www.speedtest.net" target="_blank">Speedtest.Net</a></font><br />
- <font color="#618430"><a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/" target="_blank">Speakeasy Speedtest</a></font>... Choose Seattle for your server
<br><br>

If you're using Picnik at work, there might be some restrictions on your bandwidth that would prevent Picnik from working properly. You might want to check with your IT department to see if this is the case. Another way to verify this is to check if it occurs on other computers in the network.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>How do I delete my account?</b></font><br>
You can delete your account now by clicking the Home tab, then 'My Account'. There is a button there to delete.  For Premium users, uncheck the auto-renew option and when your subscription expires, you will see the option to delete your account. Please note, when you do it, it will log you out and close any image you currently have open.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>Facebook says I have no pictures!</b></font><br>
This is likely your privacy settings in Facebook. Go to Facebook.com and click "Privacy" in Facebook (top-right corner). Next click "Applications", then "Other Applications", and finally check the two photos-related checkboxes. Also make sure the "Do not share any information..." button is not selected.
<br>

<font size="18" color="#005580"><b>NetHope Members:</b></font>
<br>
<font size="15"><b>I work with a NetHope member nonprofit organization. How do I get my free Premium subscription?</b></font><br>
Easy! Go to our Email Verification page and enter your email address. You'll quickly receive an email which will verify you work for the organization in question. Click on the link in the email and hey presto, you're a Picnik Premium member! We're happy to help support the work you do!
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>The nonprofit agency I work for is a NetHope member but my email verification won't work. What do I do now?</b></font><br>
We work with NetHope member agencies to ensure we've got the right authorizations for each of them. Please let your internal NetHope contact know there's a problem and they will get in touch with us.
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>I work for a nonprofit organization which isn't a NetHope member agency. Do I get Picnik Premium too?</b></font><br>
The NetHope network is made up of more than 25 international NGOs employing more than 300,000 people doing humanitarian and conservation work around the world. Picnik is a small company which is proud to support the work the NetHope member agencies do, and although we would find it difficult to be of service to every nonprofit, through NetHope we believe we can make a huge impact.
