<font size="14"><b>So what's this doing inside Flickr?</b></font><br>
Flickr is the best place to store, search, and share photos. Picnik is the best place to edit, improve, and embellish photos. So just like peanut butter and jelly, tomatoes and basil, beans and toast, tea and scones, mandarin oranges and Christmas morning, our partnership is designed to bring the very best photo editing to the very best photo site on the web. 
<br><br>

<font size="14"><b>As an old school Picnik user, I'm thrilled to see that Picnik editing experience is now integrated so seamlessly into Flickr.  But how do I get to the rest of Picnik's features?</b></font><br>
Easy! Just click the Picnik menu at the top left of Picnik Lite and choose "Open in Picnik.com" and Picnik will automatically have the photo you were working on waiting for you there. Or, you can go directly to <font color="#618430"><a href="http://www.mywebsite.com/" target="_blank">www.mywebsite.com</a></font> for access to the full Picnik feature set.
<br><br>
<font size="14"><b>I upgraded to a Picnik Premium account at Picnik.com, but Picnik Lite inside of Flickr doesn't seem to know that. What do I do?</b></font><br>
No problem, just look for the "Have a Picnik account?" link at the bottom of Picnik Lite, sign in, and we'll synch up the two accounts for you!
<br><br>

<font size="14"><b>If I save my picture back out to Flickr, will it overwrite the original photo or post a new photo?</b></font><br>
This depends on the type of Flickr account you have.  If you have a basic (free) Flickr account, saving a Picnik-ed photo back out to Flickr will add a new photo to your existing album.  If you have a premium Flickr account, you have the option of either overwriting the original photo, or saving a new copy.
<br><br>
<font size="14"><b>If I rename a Flickr photo in Picnik, will the change be reflected in Flickr?</b></font><br>
Yes.  Picnik wants to simplify your photos experience in everyway possible.  If you rename a photo or change a description in Picnik, those changes will simply be reflected at the photo's source as if they were one and the same.  This also works in Picasa Web Albums.
<br><br>

<font size="14"><b>What's this new Basket business?</b></font><br>
The Picnik Basket is a new feature that allows you easy access to the photos that you want to edit, so you can edit them quickly and efficiently one right after the other.
<br><br>

<font size="14"><b>How do I choose a new photo to edit from the Photo Basket?</b></font><br>
Double click the thumbnail and hey-presto! If you were editing another photo
at the time, Picnik will ask you if you want to save the changes or discard them before opening the new one.
<br><br>

<font size="14"><b>I want to apply the same edits to all of the photos in my Basket. Can I?</b></font><br>
Not yet! But it's something we get a lot of requests about, so we're working on it.
