<font size="15" color="#005580"><b>Featured Picniker - Vinci Galang</b></font> <font color="#666666">(Jun 27)</font><br /> 
  Our second Featured Picniker is Vinci Galang, a 24-year-old Filipino living in Makati, one of the cities making up the greater metropolitan area of Manila. He graduated with a degree in computer science, likes video games, anime, art, rock music and Star Wars, and lists his tools of the trade as "Crap Literature and Boring Photography plus Picnik Editing." His Flickr photostream and Deviant Art gallery are full of portraits which demonstrate a sutble and artful use of Picnik that goes beyond simple photo editing. A perfect candidate, therefore, for our second-ever Featured Picniker! <b><font color="#618430"><a href="http://blog.mywebsite.com/2008/06/featured-picniker-vinci-galang/" target="_blank">Read the full interview »</a></font></b>
