<font size="14"><b>What is Picnik?</b></font><br>
Picnik is photo editing awesomeness, online, in your browser. It's the easiest way on the Web to fix underexposed photos, remove red-eye, or apply effects to your photos. 
<br><br>
{external_faq}
<br><br>
<font size="15"><b>I'm head over heels in love. Can I pay you guys for more awesomeness?</b></font><br>
Absolutely! Picnik Premium is available in three handy sizes: $4.95 a month, $19.95 for six months or $24.95 for a year (that's just $2.08 a month!) and gets you access to way, way more cool stuff. You'll get a completely ad-free experience, all the effects, dozens of shapes and fonts, plus previews of new features, premium support, and advanced editing tools like Curves and Levels!<br>
<font size="14"><b>What's the difference between <font color="#005580">Free</font>  and <font color="#005580">Premium</font>?</b></font>
<br>
<font color="#005580">Free:</font> 6 fonts, 39 shapes and all the connections to your favorite photo websites. PLUS almost all Edit tools and a really useful set of the effects and frames. You can do amazing things with Picnik and your photos without paying a dime.
<br><br>
<font color="#005580">Premium:</font> A huge library of new fonts and shapes (over 200 and added to all the time), touch up tools, and 20 more gorgeous effects and frames. Plus, as a subscriber you automatically have access to the Picnik Premium Feature Stream of new effects, fonts, frames, shapes, tools and everything else as they're added, a whole year of all that for $24.95. 
<br><br>
We love <b>all</b> our users and will keep adding to the Free and Premium versions of Picnik so either version will be the best available.
<br><br>

<font size="18" color="#005580"><b>Other Issues:</b></font>
<br>
<font size="14"><b>How far back does 'Undo' really go?</b></font><br>
All the way.  One cool feature of Picnik is you never have to worry about making a mistake; 'Undo' can take the photo all the way back to its original state one edit at a time if you choose.
<br><br>

<font size="14"><b>I forgot my password, and then I forgot my username! What do I do?</b></font><br>
As long as you gave Picnik a valid email when you signed up, you're OK. Just click the 'Sign in' link at the top right of Picnik, then click the 'Request a new password' link at the top right of the sign in dialog. Enter in your email address and we'll send you a new password right away.
<br><br>
<font size="14"><b>What about my privacy? Does Picnik share my content with anyone?</b></font><br>
No. We believe privacy is very important and we are protective of the privacy of our users' content. For our full privacy policy, see 'Privacy Policy.'
<br><br>
<font size="14"><b>Are you going to add more editing features or creative tools?</b></font><br>
We're working hard on that.  But <b>YOU</b> can help us better understand what new features might be most useful by using the <b>Feedback</b> section.  Please tell us what additional tools you'd like to see that would truly make Picnik your 'one-stop-shop' for editing all your digital photos.
<br><br>
<font size="14"><b>How do I keep apprised of Picnik's updates?</b></font><br>
Check out <font color="#618430"><a href="http://blog.mywebsite.com/" target="_blank">our blog</a></font>; we're constantly improving Picnik and adding new features. Plus, if you don't have a Premium Account, make sure to Register to get occassional emails about our important news and updates. 

<br><br>
<font size="18" color="#005580"><b>Premium Questions:</b></font>
<br>
<font size="14"><b>What happens if my Premium account expires?</b></font><br>
No worries, nothing gets deleted. You can still use Picnik as a non-Premium user where you can always click on the "Upgrade Now" button and re-Premium yourself.
<br><br>
<font size="14"><b>Who do I contact to talk about my credit card questions?</b></font><br>
Email us at <font color="#618430"><a href="mailto:billing@mywebsite.com" target="_blank">billing@mywebsite.com</a></font>, we'll get right back to you.
<br><br>
<font size="18" color="#005580"><b>Troubleshooting:</b></font>
<br>
<font size="14"><b>What are the system requirements for running Picnik?</b></font><br>
At minimum we recommend that you have Microsoft Windows XP/Vista, Mac OS X or Linux, with a 1GHz processor or better, and at least 512 MB of RAM. You will also need a web browser such as Internet Explorer version 6.0 or higher, Firefox 2.0 or higher, or Safari 2 or higher.
<br><br>
<font size="14"><b>Why did I need to download Flash 9 to run Picnik?</b></font><br>
Picnik itself is a lightweight and 'download-less' experience. But it does require Flash 9 to be installed in order to have the rich, full-featured experience of photo-editing within a browser.
<br>

<br><br>
<font size="14"><b>Will Picnik affect my computer&#8217;s performance?</b></font><br>
No, Picnik was built with performance in mind and we consider its speed one of its many advantages over other photo editing solutions. Because it runs in a web browser, you should be able to run Picnik in much the same way that you would any other web app.
<br><br>
<font size="14"><b>What do I do if Picnik does not load, or only loads the title bar?
<br>What do I do if I get errors when trying to Save my photos?
<br>My photos stop loading at 50%, what's wrong?</b></font>
<br>
This behavior means that the local settings and configurations on your computer or network are preventing Picnik from working properly.
<br><br>
1. First, it is amazing how many issues can be resolved with refreshing or reloading Picnik.  Click the refresh button in your browser or press Ctrl+F5 for a forced, unconditional refresh.
<br><br>
2. Try installing or re-installing the latest version of Flash player (even if you already have it installed), using one of the following links:
<br>
<font color="#618430"><b><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" target="_blank">Download
Flash Player for Windows (2000, XP or Vista) here &#187;</a></b></font>
<br>
<font color="#618430"><b><a href="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash&amp;promoid=BIOW" target="_blank">Download
Flash Player for Mac OS X (all processors) here &#187;</a></b></font>
<br><br>
3. Next, make sure your browser settings for JavaScript and
secure content are set as follows:<br>

<br>
<b>In Internet Explorer for Windows,</b> select Tools-&gt;Internet Options:

<br>
a) On the second tab, Security, click the
Default Level button. 
<br>
b) Next, click on Trusted Sites in the upper scroll window,
and then click the Sites button below it. Uncheck &quot;Require Sever
Verification https...&quot; at the bottom, then enter
&quot;*.mywebsite.com,&quot; then click the Add button, then click the Close
button. 
<br>
c) On the third tab, Privacy, move the
slider to Medium.
<br>
d) On the fifth tab, Connections, click the LAN Settings button. Click the checkbox for &quot;Automatically detect settings&quot; if it isn't already and uncheck the checkbox for &quot;Use a
proxy server for your LAN&quot; if it is selected. Click OK.
<br>
e) On the last tab, Advanced, click the
Restore Defaults button (this is called the Restore Advanced Settings button in
IE7). Click OK at the bottom of the Internet Options box.

<br><br>
<b>In Safari for Mac OSX,</b> select
Safari-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Security Tab. Under Web Content check every option
except for &quot;Block pop ups.&quot;

<br><br>
<b>If you use Firefox,</b> make sure to disable add-ons
(extensions) like Adblock, Flashblock, or NoScript.<br>

<br><b>Internet Explorer for Windows, Firefox for Windows,
Firefox for Mac OS X, Safari for Mac OS X or Firefox for Linux are our only supported browsers.</b>
<br><br>

4. If you are using a personal Internet firewall or anti-virus program, it could be blocking the Flash portions of the Picnik
site. Try allowing access to http://www.mywebsite.com and https://www.mywebsite.com within those programs and then try visiting Picnik again. If still no results, try disabling such programs entirely as a test. If
that solves the issue, contact customer support for your security software to discuss allowing Flash content when browsing the internet.
<br><br>

5. Another possibility is that your system time/date is
incorrect, which can cause issues with Picnik's security certificates. Make
sure to set your system clock to the current date and time.
<br><br>

6. Finally, you should try restarting your browser (and then
if issue persists, try rebooting your computer).
<br><br>
If none of the above steps allow the Picnik to run properly, please hit the Feedback button in the upper right corner of your screen.
<br><br>

<font size="14"><b>Does my connection speed\bandwidth matter to Picnik opening or saving photos?</b></font>
<br>
Even if your connection is rated at sufficient bandwidth, sometimes there ahere are issues that cause your actual throughput [a measure of how fast data is able to move across your internet connection] to fall below the minimum required for Picnik to perform well. To verify you're getting at least 150 kbps from your broadband connection, try visiting a speed-test site (here are a couple that we like):

<br>
- <font color="#618430"><a href="http://www.bandwidthplace.com/speedtest/" target="_blank">Bandwidth Place Speed Test</a> </font><br />
- <font color="#618430"><a href="http://promos.mcafee.com/speedometer/test_0600.asp" target="_blank">McAfee Internet Connection Speedometer</a></font><br />
- <font color="#618430"><a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/" target="_blank">Speakeasy Speedtest</a></font>... Choose Seattle for your server
<br><br>

If you're using Picnik at work, there might be some restrictions on your bandwidth that would prevent Picnik from working properly. You might want to check with your IT department to see if this is the case. Another way to verify this is to check if it occurs on other computers in the network.
<br><br>
<font size="14"><b>How do I delete my account?</b></font><br>
You actually don't need to!  We keep all our user data safe and secure and never sell it.  We will only send you mail about Picnik releases if you indicated you'd like that information when you registered.  And you can turn that off, by the way, by clicking the Settings tab above.
If you'd still like your account deleted, please send us a message by clicking "Feedback" in the top right.
