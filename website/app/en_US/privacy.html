<font size="14"><b>Will any of my personal information be shared with 3rd parties?</b></font><br>
No. If it were up to us, spammers would be tarred and feathered.  Also, if Picnik becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.<br>
<br>
<font size="14"><b>Does Picnik store my Flickr password?</b></font><br>

Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of our privacy policy in an archive for your review. We will continue to always keep our users apprised of updates.<br>
